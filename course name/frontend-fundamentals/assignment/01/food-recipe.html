  <h3>How to make...</h3>

  <blockquote><!--blockquote/start-->

  <p>
   This delightfully delicious; and, also, really healthy dish is made up as follows...
  </p>

  <!--this is an ol-ordered list/containing a number of bulleted li-list items-->

  <ol><!--ol:ordered list/start-->
   <li>First, put an empty frying pan onto the fire to heat up...using only a <em>mild</em> heat</li>
   <li>Next, place into the frying pan a heaped tablespoon full of butter...wait until the heated butter has, already, fully <em>melted</em>.</li>
   <li>Break 2 x eggs; and, pour into frying pan.</li>
   <li>Dice 1 x small onion; and, also, place into the frying pan.</li>
   <li>Dice 1 x large pepper/(or, multiple smaller green peppers); and, place into the frying pan.</li>
   <li>Dice 1 x tomato; and, place into the frying pan.</li>
   <li>Sprinkle in a teaspoon full of table salt.</li>
   <li>Sprinkle in a teaspoon full of table pepper.</li>
  </ol><!--ol:ordered list/end-->

  <p><!--paragraph/start-->
   -(<b>NOTE:</b> As the food is being heated inside of the frying pan...; then, <em>keep on stirring, continually...; </em> in order to ensure that all food items are properly <strong>intermixed</strong> together.)-
  </p><!--paragraph/end-->

  </blockquote><!--blockquote/end-->

  <!--level 3 sub-heading--> 
  <h3>Here are some other tips...which can be used to <em>modify</em> the same above food recipe...</h3>

  <blockquote><!--blockquote/start-->

   <!--level 4 sub-heading-->
   <h4>Dietry advice</h4>

   <p>If you are on a diet; then, use...</p>
  
   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>1 x egg...(as opposed to using 2).</li>
    <li>Instead, of using a whole onion/or, a whole tomato...just cut these in half/or, even use a quarter.
    <li>Rather than use butter to fry the food in...leave out the butter, altogether; and, stir fry in a few tablespoons of water, instead.</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->

   <p><!--paragraph/start-->
    -(<b>NOTE:</b> The only reason I said use, 2 eggs/a whole onion/a whole tomato/a whole pepper; is when you wish to have further plate servings that includes: seconds/thirds/-etc.)-
   </p><!--paragraph/end-->

   <!--level 4 sub-heading-->
   <h4>Other advice concerning taste</h4>

   <p>Dish, too hot...?!</p>

   <!--this is an ul-unordered list/containing a number of bulleted li-list items-->

   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>Because, the recipe uses pepper ingredients, <em>twice</em>; in order to make it taste less <strong>hot</strong>...leave out the use of large peppers; and, simply, use table pepper, alone.</li>
    <br>
    <li>My own experience is, if you don't add some <em>table pepper/table salt</em>; then, the dish tends to taste far too <em>fresh</em>...meaning slightly tasteless.</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->



   <hr><!--horizontal rule-->



   <h4>Adding extra ingredients</h4>

   <p>Sometimes, I will add extra ingredients into the pot, such as...</p>

   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>Mild cheddar cheese/(diced)/(If I don't wish to have <em>fried/melted</em> cheese...; then, I just eat the cheese to go along with it, plain.)</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->


   <p>The dish can be made to taste even nicer still...if you were to add in, afterwards, to go on top of it all...</p>

   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>Some diced Cucumber slices</li>
    <li>Guava pear...whole/or, sliced</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->

   <!--level 4 sub-heading-->
   <h4>The key to happy eating is plenty of variety...</h4>

   <p>I discovered that the key to happy eating is to employ as much variety in your own home cooking, as is possible...; then, you will never get, well and truly, <em>bored</em> with what you are eating. So, I will make this same dish using a variety of different ways:-</p>

   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>Scrambled eggs (plain)/(add pepper and salt to taste)</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced tomato</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced tomato/diced cheese</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced tomato/diced large pepper/large onion</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced half-tomato/diced small peppers/half-an-onion/cucumber slices</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced tomato/diced large pepper/large onion/guava pear</li>
    <li>Scrambled eggs/diced tomato/diced large pepper/large onion/cucumber/guava pear/bread and ham sandwich</li>
    <li>-etc.</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->

   <p>Basically, my aim is to never make the same dish, twice, using all of the exact same ingredients; thus, feel free to be able to <em>experiment</em> to your own heart's content with proportions/ingredients/add on's...</p>

   <ul><!--ul:undefined list/start-->
    <li>Sometimes, I have it with a couple slices of buttered brown bread.</li>
    <li>Another time, I have it with cream crackers biscuits.</li>
    <li>A next time, I place it inside of a tortilla wrap.</li>
    <li>I will try it with a stick of French loaf bread.</li>
    <li>And, so on...</li>
   </ul><!--ul:undefined list/end-->

   <h3 class="clsWarning">Cautionary notes</h3>

   <p> 
    With some food dishes: potatoes/rice/-etc.; you can turn the fire <em>on</em>; then, simply, walk away from it...for 1/2 an hour...to find that whenever you come back...the food is, now, fully cooked; and, ready to eat.
   </p>

   <p>
    This is <strong>not</strong> one of those dishes...; one has to remember that this food dish cooks really <em>fast</em>...; so, in approximately 10 minutes long, it's all ready and done.
   </p> 

   <ol type="i"><!--ol:ordered list, type: roman numbers, lower case/start-->
    <li>If you don't continually stir the ingredients together...; then, it's possible that the ingredients will burn 'sticking' quite solidly to the bottom of the frying pan; and, with the topmost ingredients not having been properly cooked; plus, the ingredients may not have been properly mixed.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Indeed, if you walk away from <em>any</em> food that's cooking...; then, return back to see how it's doing, later on; especially, if you forget(because, you were watching TV/Internet/or, accidentally, fell asleep)?! It's possible the food may, actually, burn...turning charcoal black/(nevermind, you could actually start a fire if the pot burns, too)...thus, at best, the food becomes totally <strong>inedible</strong>(you have to throw it away in the bin; waste of precious time/effort/money)! At worse, your whole entire house burns down...; and, then, you better make sure you brought proper house insurance(that is, if you still remain, <em>alive</em>).</li>
    </li>
   </ol><!--ol:ordered list, type: roman numbers, lower case/end-->

   <ol type="A"><!--ordered list, type: alphabetic capitals/start-->

    <li>
     Cooking can prove extremely 'hazardous to health'...it's, certainly, <strong>not</strong> a game; leave it to the <em>grown up's</em> to do it!
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
     If you must walk away from a dish that is cooking...; then, please, buy a kitchen timer as these tend to be relatively <em>cheap</em>, now-a-days; then, next, remember to use it..?! They come with a built-in alarm...that goes off once the timer has been set.          <br><br>
    </li>

    <li>
     Alternatively, you may ask...
     <ul>
      <li>Google</li>
      <li>Alexa</li>
      <li>Siri</li>
      <li>Cortana</li>
     </ul>
...to set an automatic timer to remind you whenever 10 minutes are up.
    </li>

    <br>

    <li>
     Remember your local/national emergency number to call: 
     <dl><!--dl-definition list/start-->
      <dt>999</dt>
      <dd>(UK emergency services)</dd>
      <dt>911</dt>
      <dd>(USA emergency services)</dd>
     </dl><!--dl-definition list/end-->
...then, when somebody at the other end picks up...quite calmly and clearly state which particular emergency service it is you need: Fire/Ambulance/Police; also, tell them where to come.
    </li>

   </ol><!--ordered list, type: alphabetic capitals/end-->
