BROUGHT 14 x COURSE PROGRAMMING BUNDLE/EACH WITH LIFETIME ACCESS/PLUS, CERTIFICATES

Mon 5th Oct 2020  

I brought from Pirple.com at a cost of: $49.00 USD/Â£39.66 GBP, a 14 x Course Programming Bundle - Lifetime Access - All Certificates Included

- PythonIsEasy (Python 3.x)
- Frontend-Fundamentals (HTML/CSS)
- Etc.

This is the main GitHub folder repository where I will store the completed homework assignments in regards to each particular course that I'm currently working on.

A LEARNER CANNOT CONTINUE ONTO THE 'NEXT' LESSON UNTIL WHEN THEY'VE PASSED THE CURRENT ASSIGNMENT

What's really interesting about this course...is it 'forces' you to do it 'hands on'; so, it's not a case of you can just merely sit back and watch a few videos...then, when you get to the end of seeing all videos -(whether you are actually at the screen/or, asleep)-; then, you can 'magically' go ahead and claim a certificate...whether you understood/or, not?!

Instead, here you have to prove...by reading/watching vidos, first; then, completing/and, handing in each assignment lesson to be marked by an online tutor...assignment feedback is sent through email whether you either passed/or, failed.

NOTE: One is NOT allowed to continue onto the 'next' part of the lesson...until you have passed what is the current assignment 'test'; which, in turn, means you have to 'wait' for the tutor feedback...before being allowed to move on.
